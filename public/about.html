    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I always strive to complete my work as early as possible so that I can use
      the remaining time to gather more knowledge and skills. I possess strong
      leadership qualities, which naturally make me very punctual. I always aim
      to be the leader of the team, and I consistently get the opportunity to
      take on that role. I don't claim to do smart work; rather, I believe in
      being adaptable so that I can adjust my approach to meet the demands of
      any situation.
